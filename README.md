# Python_APIs_Challenge
---

## Overview
This project utilizes two APIs, OpenWeather and Gmaps, to compile a list of cities across the globe to analyze their weather patterns. The program focuses on four aspects of weather, maximum temperature, humidity, cloudiness and wind speed. The information gathered for the cities is then used to graph the different weather elements and then make comparisons between the northern and southern hemisphere. From the cities gathered an analysis is then done in a separate notebook to narrow down the list based on optimal temperature, humidity, and wind speed. Using the newly generated data frame, hotels near each city are located and mapped.
